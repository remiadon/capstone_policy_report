## Research question
This capstone project begins with a simple observation: over recent decades, **commuting distances have surged across most developed economies**, even as these same economies face mounting pressure to align with the Paris Agreement’s climate goals. Far from an isolated anomaly, this trend serves as a measurable indicator of deeper socio-economic shifts.

The first section explores the intricate relationship between commuting distance, car dependency, and their far-reaching consequences—not only for climate change but also for public health and economic well-being. Given that long commutes (over 10 km) account for 80% of commuting-related CO2 emissions in France (Wagner, Laure), **analyzing evolving commuting patterns and their associated economic dependencies becomes essential**.
This analysis extends to dissecting major societal backlashes, such as the Yellow Vests movement, by examining key distinctions: economic landscapes versus regulatory triggers, or the tension between rational economic behavior and perception-driven actions. Such an approach promises fresh insights into the “green divide” and the complexities of transitioning to sustainable economies.
This work advances several hypotheses, including the idea that the Yellow Vests movement was less a crisis of declining living standards (only 10% of protesters earned below €800/month, a figure above the poverty line) and more a **product of localized economic dependencies and perceptions**—particularly among workers facing high commuting costs—**ignited by a national, perception-driven policy** (e.g., the carbon tax, whose burdens policymakers themselves rarely endure).
The interplay between these perceptions and dependencies lies at the heart of this thesis; However, this dynamic is not confined to moments of crisis; it also shapes responses to progressive regulations like Low-Emission Zones.
Through **interviews conducted in three distinct regions**—Lot-et-Garonne (France), the Bayonne-Anglet-Biarritz area (French Basque Country), and Greater London—this study maps the incentives of diverse stakeholders, seeking to explain **how such volatile socio-economic landscapes emerge and how perception fuels both dependency and resistance**.Despite their apparent differences, **these regions reveal striking structural parallels**; a good example being the discretion to construction permits given to mayors, with immediate consequences on urban sprawl.
(Some of the key) hypotheses:
- The Yellow Vest crisis is rooted in local initiatives driven by local civil servant
incentives but also the perception of local citizen–particularly new suburbans priced out of economic centers who perceive property as a basic need and underestimate its hidden costs.
- National policies often embody the biased perceptions of policymakers, who may regard property as a financial, rather indulgent, asset rather than a source of constraints (e.g., lock-in effects) for the broader population
- The state’s laissez-faire approach fosters micro-economic dependencies and resistance to change. When regulations overlook marginalized groups, governments face backlash, eroding trust in (supra-)national institutions

The final chapter proposes policy guidelines, emphasizing **incentive-based and perception-driven strategies**. Since addressing climate change requires systemic economic shifts, **these guidelines will target sectors beyond transport—such as housing—that directly influence commuting distances**.
For instance, an initial proposal considered tax incentives for landlords to relocate workers closer to their workplaces. While further research revealed significant limitations to this approach, it remains a useful baseline for exploring more sophisticated—and likely more effective—policy interventions.
